~ has list of bootcamps that entry level and jr. devs can look into/review
~ has a link and details of bootcamp

Community posts
~ Community posts are in request form:
 * Meetups
  - Asking for fellow devs or devs in the making to meetup (conditions through questions will apply     to how to request is made[almost like a servey that can both be made as a filter for those who      wish for a meet up])

 * Collaborations
  - Asking for fellow devs to collaborate in projects (this would be a feature for students or devs     who are looking for people that are intrested in making and/or taking part in projects).

 * Assistance
  - Asking for fellow devs for assistance on bugs, projects, errors, etc. (almost like a social         platorm related to stackoverflow)
